# AStar
This is a simple project written in Java that uses the A* algorithm to solve a small user-defined problem.
I have also provided an executable to demonstrate what it is capable of.

### Description
The user will define a starting node and a goal node on a 15x15 node board. The algorithm will then attempt
to find a path using the A* search algorithm.

### Output
The program will output a text representation of the algorithm, first with the initial state
and then a final state after a path has been found. If no path could be determined, a fail state will
be prompted.
